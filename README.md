## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🎉

👋 Howdy! I'm Marco, Canadian🍁 born and raised, based in Italy!🤌 I'm an enthusiastic and committed developer focusing on back-end development with **Java, Spring, and object-oriented programming (OOP)**. I'm delighted to share my projects, code snippets, and the ups and downs of my educational journey through my GitHub profile.

## About Me

🚀 My knack for **logical thinking and love of anything and everything tech** has driven me towards a career in software development. I embarked on my journey with Java, gaining a solid grasp of the language's intricacies and its object-oriented concepts. As I dove deeper into the realm of back-end development, I was introduced to the efficiency and elegance of the Spring framework, which has since become an integral part of my toolkit.

## What You'll Discover Here

📂 This repository houses a compilation of projects and code examples that showcase my prowess in back-end development, particularly in Java and Spring. **These projects display my evolution from a novice to a developer** with, hopefully, a substantial amount of knowledge and experience as I continue to wade through the coding seas.

## My Interests

✨ Although my primary focus lies in **back-end development**, I'm also very interested in exploring other facets of software development with the end goal of becoming a proficient **full-stack developer**! I firmly believe that comprehending both the back-end and front-end sides of development is indispensable for crafting robust and user-friendly applications. Beyond that, I'm **captivated by the realms of software and game development**, **C#** being my gateway language prior to my dive into all things Java.

🎮 An avid **gamer**, I enjoy all sides of gaming whether it be cooperative or competitive. There's nothing quite like collaborating with others to achieve a common goal or testing your skills against others that push you to improve or approach problems from a different angle you hadn't considered before!

👻 Horror **movie** enjoyer! From a very young age I loved scary movies! All movies are great but the thrill of facing something that scares you and being able to laugh it off afterwards is a talent I had to work hard to earn!

🍳 **Cooking** is another skill I picked up at a very young age alongside with my love of horror films! In order to avoid having nightmares, I would watch the cooking channel before bed! Learning a new recipe is one of the many small ways we can get out of our comfort zones and once we've picked up the basics, it's always great to experiment with different ingredients to make the dish your own!

## Collaboration and Feedback

🤝 I'm always **open to collaboration** which means **feedback is welcomed and appreciated**! If you come across something intriguing or have ideas for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out or send a pull request. Constructive criticism is the best way to learn and thrive so I eagerly look forward to learning from the community!
